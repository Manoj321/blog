Hello, I'm Manoj. Welcome to my site. I'm a Software Engineer by profession. I love hacking on opensource technologies. I occasionally write about Emacs, DevOps, Home lab etc.. I'm also a Dad ðŸ‘¦ so you might see some related ramblings as well. 

I was a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Sciences and then moved to US to pursue Masters at University of California, Irvine. Currently I live in the Bay area working for Arista Networks in EngProd Team.
